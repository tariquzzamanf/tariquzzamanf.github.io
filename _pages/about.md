I am a <a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/tariquzzaman/education">Junior Lecturer</a> in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the <a href="https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/">Islamic University of Technology</a>. I am also a part of the SSL-Lab.

My research interests lie in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Human Computer Interaction.

Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from IUT. I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate researcher advised by <a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/mohsinul/education">Md. Mohsinul Kabir</a> at the SSL-Lab.
