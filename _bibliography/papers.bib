    abstract = "This paper introduces a novel informal Bangla word embedding for designing a cost-efficient solution for the task {\textquotedblleft}Violence Inciting Text Detection{\textquotedblright} which focuses on developing classification systems to categorize violence that can potentially incite further violent actions. We propose a semi-supervised learning approach by training an informal Bangla FastText embedding, which is further fine-tuned on lightweight models on task specific dataset and yielded competitive results to our initial method using BanglaBERT, which secured the 7th position with an f1-score of 73.98{\%}. We conduct extensive experiments to assess the efficiency of the proposed embedding and how well it generalizes in terms of violence classification, along with it`s coverage on the task`s dataset. Our proposed Bangla IFT embedding achieved a competitive macro average F1 score of 70.45{\%}. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of our findings, delving into potential causes of misclassification in the detection of violence-inciting text."
